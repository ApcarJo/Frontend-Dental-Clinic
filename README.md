## About :speech_balloon:

Challenge from the Fullstack Developer Bootcamp at <a href="https://geekshubsacademy.com/">GeeksHubs Academy</a> where we have to create the frontend for a dental clinic.

The purpose of this design is to recreate the frontend part of our Dental Clinic. 

In this website you could register as a dentist or as a client and then login or logout. 

If you are a dentist you could see your profile, find all the active clinics, view your schedule in the last month or update your information. 

If you are a client you could view all dentists and clinics, create a new appointment, modify or delete it and finally you could also modify your personal information if you need.

This Project has been done by [Jos√© Luis Aparicio](https://github.com/ApcarJo), [Alejandro Urbina](https://github.com/2020-JAUG) and [Adriana Fayos](https://github.com/AdrianaFayos). 

Starting date: June 8th 2021. <br>
Due date: June 20th 2021.

We have used the Trello in order to share the tasks and to have a better organization.

As a dentist, check your dynamic schedule that updates all the info and shows in real time the appointments of each month, this is not a library, is pure javascript react redux code.

This is our DATEPICKER PURE JAVASCRIPT CODE created for the project. It's a component that uses redux to send the data to each container where is used (clientregister.jsx, dentistregister.jsx, and dentistprofile.jsx container views). It can show the months by name, write the year in roman numerals, and some other calculations related to the date, this options are in the code but not activated for the project. Part of the code is used to create the dynamic schedule draw in dentist profile.
